# Yaml-to-SQL-SpringBoot

This project aims to provide a solution for parsing YAML files and saving the data to a SQL database using Spring Boot. The application utilizes the Spring Boot framework to create REST APIs that handle the parsing and data storage operations. The parsed data from the YAML files is persisted in a SQL database, enabling easy retrieval and management.

## Getting Started

To get started with the YAML-to-SQL-SpringBoot project, follow these steps:

To get started with this project, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Spring Boot project**: Set up a new Spring Boot project using your preferred IDE or by using Spring Initializr. This project will serve as the foundation for building the YAML-to-MySQL connector.
2. **Add dependencies**: Include the necessary dependencies in your project's `pom.xml` file. You'll need dependencies for Spring Web, Spring Data JPA, and the MySQL database driver. These dependencies will enable you to develop REST APIs and interact with the MySQL database.
3. **Create a model class**: Define a Java class that represents the structure of the data in the YAML file. In this case, you can create a `Person` class with properties like `name`, `age`, `email`, and optional additional fields like `address`. This model class will be used to map the YAML data to Java objects.
4. **Parse the YAML file**: Utilize a YAML parsing library, such as Jackson or SnakeYAML, to read and parse the YAML file. You can use the library's API to convert the YAML data into a list of `Person` objects, including any additional fields like `address` if present.
5. **Set up database configuration**: Configure your Spring Boot application to connect to your MySQL database. Specify the database URL, username, password, and any other required configuration properties in the `application.properties` or `application.yml` file. This configuration will allow your application to establish a connection to the MySQL database.
6. **Create a repository interface**: Define a repository interface that extends `JpaRepository` or `CrudRepository`. This interface will provide the necessary CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations for interacting with the MySQL database. You can use this repository to save the parsed `Person` objects to the database.
7. **Implement the REST APIs**: Create REST API endpoints in a controller class to handle the HTTP requests for adding the parsed data to the MySQL database. Map the appropriate HTTP methods (e.g., POST) and URL paths to the corresponding controller methods. These APIs will serve as the entry points for receiving the YAML data and triggering the database operations.
8. **Write the business logic**: In the controller methods, call the repository methods to save the parsed `Person` objects to the MySQL database. Use the repository's `save` method to persist the data. You can also include additional business logic if needed, such as data validation or error handling.
9. **Test the APIs**: Test your REST APIs using tools like Postman or by writing unit tests to ensure the data is successfully added to the MySQL database. Verify that the endpoints are correctly receiving the YAML data, parsing it, and storing it in the database. This step will help ensure the reliability and correctness of your application.

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```shell
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/YAML-to-SQL-SpringBoot.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:

   ```shell
   cd YAML-to-SQL-SpringBoot
   ```
3. Build the project using Maven:

   ```shell
   mvn clean install
   ```
4. Configure the MySQL database:

   - Create a new database in your MySQL server.
   - Update the database configuration in the `application.properties` file with your database URL, username, and password.
5. Run the application:

   ```shell
   mvn spring-boot:run
   ```

### Usage

1. Prepare your YAML file: Create a YAML file with the data you want to parse and store in the SQL database. Ensure the YAML file follows the appropriate structure and contains the required fields.
2. Access the REST APIs: Use tools like Postman or any HTTP client to send HTTP requests to the exposed REST APIs. The available endpoints include:

   - `POST /upload`: Send a POST request to this endpoint with the YAML file content in the request body. The application will parse the YAML data and store it in the SQL database.
3. Verify the data: Check your MySQL database to verify that the parsed data from the YAML file has been successfully stored.
